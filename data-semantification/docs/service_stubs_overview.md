# Service Stubs Overview for Data Reception in Apache NiFi

## Introduction to Service Stubs

Service stubs are provisional implementations for services or components that are under development. They simulate the behavior of the intended final service, allowing other parts of the system to continue development, testing, and integration activities. This is especially beneficial in projects where development occurs in parallel across different system components.

## Purpose of Service Stubs in Our Apache NiFi Project

Our project utilizes Apache NiFi to receive and process data from a variety of sources, including robots and sensors. The data arriving from these sources can be in multiple formats, necessitating a flexible and scalable approach to data reception and processing. To accommodate this variety, we plan to assign a unique NiFi endpoint to each data format, starting with NumPy `.npy` files. Service stubs will play a crucial role in this strategy by providing temporary endpoints for each new data format we plan to support.

## Implementing Service Stubs for Diverse Data Formats

The implementation of service stubs allows us to simulate the reception and processing of different data formats, starting with `.npy` files. Here's an overview of how these stubs will be structured:

### NumPy `.npy` File Endpoint Stub

- **Purpose**: To simulate the reception, validation, and preliminary processing of NumPy `.npy` files.
- **Functionality**:
  - Accept `.npy` files through a dedicated endpoint.
  - Perform mock validation to ensure the files meet expected criteria.
  - Simulate basic processing or transformation that will be applied to the data.
  - Return a confirmation of receipt, along with any relevant metadata about the file.

This stub will serve as the blueprint for creating additional stubs as we expand our capabilities to include more data formats.

## Benefits of Using Service Stubs

- **Parallel Development**: Facilitates the parallel development of frontend, backend, and integration components by providing a predictable and interactive API surface.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Enables the system to easily scale and adapt to new data formats with minimal disruption to the existing infrastructure.
- **Early Testing and Validation**: Allows for early testing of the system's ability to handle different data formats, identifying potential issues before full-scale development and implementation.

## Conclusion

The use of service stubs is a strategic choice in our project's development, ensuring that we can efficiently manage a diverse range of data formats received from robots and sensors. By starting with stubs for `.npy` file processing and planning for the inclusion of more formats in the future, we are laying the groundwork for a scalable, robust Apache NiFi infrastructure.

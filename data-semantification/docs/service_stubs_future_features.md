# Upcoming Features

## Overview

Our Apache NiFi-based data reception and processing service is currently equipped to handle NumPy `.npy` files from robots and sensors. As part of our ongoing development and commitment to supporting a wide range of applications and data sources, we are planning to expand our capabilities to include the ingestion of additional file types. This document outlines the anticipated enhancements and the strategic approach we will take to implement these features.

## Planned Enhancements

### Ingestion of Various File Types

- **Objective**: To extend our service's functionality to support a diverse array of file formats beyond `.npy` files, catering to a wider range of data processing needs from our robots and sensors.
- **Approach**:
  - **Research and Analysis**: We will conduct a thorough analysis of potential file types that our system might need to support in the future. This will involve engagement with stakeholders, analysis of data sources, and understanding the requirements of our processing and analytics pipeline.
  - **API Extension**: For each new file type supported, we will extend our API to include dedicated endpoints, similar to our existing `/api/data/npy` endpoint for `.npy` files. This ensures a modular and scalable approach to data ingestion.
  - **Custom Processing Logic**: Recognizing that different file types may require unique validation, parsing, and processing steps, we will develop custom logic for each new file type. This includes leveraging Apache NiFi's capabilities for data flow management and transformation.
- **Timeline**: The timeline for these enhancements will be determined based on the outcome of our research and analysis phase. We aim to roll out support for new file types in a phased approach, ensuring thorough testing and validation at each step.

### Continuous Improvement and Scalability

- **Objective**: To ensure our service remains scalable, efficient, and capable of adapting to new data processing requirements over time.
- **Approach**:
  - **Infrastructure Optimization**: Continuously review and optimize our Apache NiFi infrastructure to handle increased data volumes and diversity.
  - **Monitoring and Feedback Loops**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and establish feedback loops to identify performance bottlenecks, usability issues, and new requirements as they arise.
- **Timeline**: Ongoing. We will prioritize optimizations and improvements based on feedback and system performance metrics.

## Conclusion

The planned enhancements to our data reception and processing service are a testament to our commitment to flexibility, scalability, and meeting the evolving needs of our stakeholders. By systematically expanding our support for additional file types and continuously improving our infrastructure, we aim to build a robust, versatile service capable of handling the diverse data landscapes of today and tomorrow.

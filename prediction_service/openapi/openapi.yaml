  title: Prediction Microservice
  description: |-
    This is prediction microservice as part of the Novel Metadata Fabric based on the OpenAPI 3.1 specification. It provides a forecasting functionality for pre-defined metrics such as daily energy consumption metrics on the GLACIATION platform. You can retrieve the most recent history and prediction of energy consumption of the platform.
    
    You can find out more about
    the prediction microservice at [https://github.com/glaciation-heu/IceStream/tree/development/prediction_service](https://github.com/glaciation-heu/IceStream/tree/development/prediction_service).

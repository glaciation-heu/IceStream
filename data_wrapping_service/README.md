# Data Wrapping Service

This service offers server-side object encryption of Kubernetes volumes,
allowing clients to take advantage of server processing power to secure objects
at the storage layer (i.e., encryption at rest).

## Overview

Encrypting Kubernetes volumes offers a robust shield for sensitive data at
rest. This not only safeguards information from unauthorized individuals who
gain physical access to storage disks or underlying nodes, but also helps meet
industry standards and regulations. By limiting the blast radius of security
incidents, it strengthens operational security and builds trust with
stakeholders.

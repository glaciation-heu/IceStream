# Secure Collaborative Computation

The Secure Collaborative Computation consists of two main services for cryptographic protection via secure multi-party computation (MPC), i.e., Computation Service and Client Service. It also considers an optional visualization service to provide utility-accuracy feedback for privacy protection, i.e., differential privacy (DP).

* [Computation Service](compute_service/docs/README.md) runs the distributed MPC computation on encrypted data.

* [Client Service](client_service/docs/README.md) provides encrypted input for the Computation Service.

* [DP Visualization Service](dp_visualization/docs/README.md) visualized utility-accuracy trade-offs for differential privacy parameterization.
